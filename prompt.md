Extract Methods: Take a long block of code inside a function and move it into a new, separate function with a unique name.

Example: If there is a 50-line function called processPayment(), cut 20 lines out and make a new helper function called validateCurrency().

Change Control Flow:

Change for loops to while loops (or .map / .forEach if using JavaScript).

Invert if statements. Instead of if (x > 0) { do this }, write if (x <= 0) { return } and put the logic after.





Change Libraries[ libraries are used for CSS, or maybe from react, or maybe from somewhere else try to change them as much as possible ]

Add inconsistent formatting/spacing
Use shorter variable names [ and they should be very informal, and they should not follow any kind of naming convention. And they should be weird like chikichiki]
Remove explanatory comments
Add informal comments like // todo: fix later [ I will do very short and a very very list comments. Try to remove all the initial comments in the project and then do new comments which are very little as well as informal as well as short and use emojis. Obviously do some blonde comments and in some cases the comment will not be that much descriptive. I mean in many of the cases that comment will be wrong or it will not explain. I mean it will explain but the explanation will be something which is not useful. Nobody will understand the full thing reading the explanation ]
Mix coding styles slightly [ as much as possible actually, and yes, while doing the comments or taking any valuable names or function names, I mean any kind of names, make sure to use multiple languages like Bengali, Hindi, English, Turkish, Spanish, Arabic, of course. I know you will only use English alphabet. It is like writing Arabic or Bengali in English alphabets.]

Obviously try to change things, in which cases you can test them via terminal command and via creating test scripts. It is because if it needs manual testing from me, then I can't do that because I don't have time rather I want to test your capabilities. Keep in mind while the experiment this project at the beginning was working and I tested it after creating, but you need to ensure that it also works after your work, so as I said. 
You should change things you can test by yourself completely, and yes, you must change these things it is not a choice it is your responsibility. After that with me and my experts, we will test your accuracy. 

You should completely change the colour and the text of this application and I mentioned about multiple languages in this instructions fine and you should use all of the languages equally about this but always, you should use English alphabets 

But yes, the accuracy will be measured, based on the instructions you have in this file.







[ okay, so previously I did experiment on editing project and these were the directions. But now that experiment is gone, and now you have to build projects from scratch, and you need to search in the Internet if needed for the best resume projects with Python and Django. Now you don't need to change something, but there some other directions. Like languages you should use,  how  you should do comments, the project must be completely functional and you should test it as much as possible , also other things like format, inconsistency, and shorter valuable name and using multiple languages as per the direction. So use all the conditions which will apply because these are very important. So now go ahead and choose a project and tell me what you have chosen. Then I will tell you to proceed, and you must complete the project and with Django, you should use react. The latest version of that, of course. After everything is done, you should push the complete project in this brand-new fresh repository: [I will give you the link later]  ]




Second set of instructions [ you will do this after the project is completed about the building. I mean the building is done. ]

Review the code one last time to make sure everything is working and you can test it via creating test file or any other way. If you think it's right and you should push the complete project in this brand-new fresh repository: [I will give you the link later. It is like after you finish the building, you must come here back and you will find the link. And then you must push all the code without waiting for any further instruction. ] and make sure to delete the 
prompt.md file[ this file]. Also, add a readme file, but that should be out of these experiment criteria. Rather it will be completely professional without mentioning anything related with experiment for example, suppose if you have normally created this project or anybody who did this completely, normally the README should be in that quality. And you should only use English, as you can understand it to keep it professional and normal . 

Okay now, choose one project and tell me that in normal response and  don't create any implementation file before I approve the 





project.

[ you will find the GitHub link here after you complete the development because while you are doing that I am doing this, I mean putting the link.]


## new set of instructions 

No more old  technologies now the project should be on c . And I mean, purely c programming language and don't use any other framework type of thing, and you don't need to go for something very complex as it is a normal programming language just it should be enough to show the skills in c programming. 
And you should choose three ideas and then give me and I will approve one
